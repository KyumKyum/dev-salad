    "description": "**Propositional logic** is the foundation for many computer science topics. It is used in formal verification, AI, and circuit design. Many learning resources are either too abstract or too simple. I wrote a guide to bridge that gap. It is for students and self-taught programmers. **This is the first article in my series on DSA fundamentals**. The guide covers **syntax, semantics, rules of inference, and normal forms.** It includes practice problems and project ideas. The full guide is available here: [https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic](https://beyondit.blog/blogs/DSA-Fundamentals-1-A-Practical-Guide-to-Propositional-Logic) I am interested in your thoughts. **How do you use logic principles in your work beyond basic control flow?**"

And in the end I circle back to PHP (with a static analyzer), trying to model the program in a similarly advanced fashion. I think the possibilities and limitations are quite fascinating. My goal is not to say \"language A good, language B bad\", but to show their state of the art. I learned a lot while working on this article and hopefully you too will find it interesting!"

    "description": "Long story short, I'm taking over a very simple project. I used to build websites ~20 years ago, so while I'm technically literate, I remember approximately 0%, and the webdev ecosystem is completely different these days, anyway. I'm not looking for someone to hold my hand and do the work for me, but I'm looking to be pointed in the right direction, and would really appreciate a more knowledgeable someone to recommend a solution. What I'm looking to do is build a very simple status website for processes. You arrive at a main/landing page (status.com), and you put a unique number into a text field and submit it. The next page that loads (process.status.com (doesn't matter)) is inspired by the dominos pizza tracker. It will tell you the percentage complete, and what the current critical path item is. That's it. Maybe even a partially filled in loading bar based on the percentage complete. Just something to give end-users/customers a happy feeling in their belly that the process is indeed being worked. The people responsible for managing the process would simply go to an \"admin page\" for their process number to update the information to be served (123456.status.com or input.status.com, url does not matter, only functionality). They could move a slider or input a number 0-100 to change percentage complete, and there would be a field there where they could type in where in the process things were at. Or maybe there could be like a dozen pre-defined checkboxes of process steps, and just checking a box would report back the correct status/percentage if queried. I have a domain, and I am playing around in Wix. Can someone in-the-know recommend a Wix app or other compatible element that would support what I'm trying to do? Wix would be preferred since I already paid for it, but honestly, if you know of something else that would be a lot easier, I'm not opposed to throwing some new money at the problem if it gets solved. Again, I'm woefully behind the times here, so apologies if I said anything dumb. I'm happy to clarify anything. Some help would be most welcome."

    "description": "Hellooo, I’ve been working as a fullstack dev for over 10 years, mostly focusing on frontend in the past 5–6 years with Vue and React. Lately I’ve been feeling the need to get back into interview mode. The market is shifting, interviews are getting weird with all kinds of tests, take-homes, system design, live pairings etc. I want to stay sharp and get used to that rhythm again. I’ve been at the same company for a few years now and while it's been good, I sometimes feel like I’m stagnating. I want to practice with real challenges, the kind that test your problem solving and architectural thinking. Not just random leetcode stuff where you feel like a human compiler. I already have some stuff in my repos like: * ecommerce apps built with React and Vue * todo lists in React, Vue, Angular and TS * a blog app in Angular * a frontend project using hexagonal architecture (this one was actually fun) * some Svelte components * a React design system prototype * other small experiments (Electron, a bit of Flutter etc) and tests. What I’d love is to get more project-based challenges. Things that require real design decisions, maybe use TDD or DDD, where I have to think about structure, scalability, separation of concerns. Something that breaks the routine and forces me out of the muscle memory zone. I’m also curious to explore Go at some point, maybe build something backend-ish too. But mostly I want to focus on the kinds of take-home or technical challenges companies use when hiring mid to senior frontend/fullstack devs. So if you’ve gone through any cool interviews and got interesting take-home tasks, even just rough ideas or prompts, I’d really appreciate if you could share them. Doesn’t have to be anything fancy or super detailed, just enough to get the brain going. All of this could be a good way to put interesting stuff on my github to let interviewers explore. The issue is that most of the times i really cant find a project that catches my interest and collaborate on github.. so in the meanwhile i'd train a bit like this. Any suggestion or idea is greatly appreciated."

    "title": "The New Generation of High-Performance Web Frameworks（1750426284509500）",
    "description": "In the current landscape of Rust Web frameworks, Hyperlane is increasingly establishing itself as a formidable contender in the \"new generation of lightweight and high-performance frameworks.\" This article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Hyperlane's strengths by comparing it with prominent frameworks like Actix-Web and Axum, focusing particularly on performance, feature integration, developer experience, and underlying architecture. Framework Architecture Comparison Framework Dependency Model Async Runtime Middleware Support SSE/WebSocket Routing Matching Capability Hyperlane Relies solely on Tokio + Standard Library Tokio ✅ Supports request/response ✅ Native support ✅ Supports regular expressions Actix-Web Numerous internal abstraction layers Actix ✅ Request middleware Partial support (requires plugins) ⚠️ Path macros necessitate explicit setup Axum Intricate Tower architecture Tokio ✅ Tower middleware ✅ Requires dependency extension ⚠️ Limited dynamic routing ✅ Overview of Hyperlane's Advantages: Zero Platform Dependency: Implemented purely in Rust, ensuring strong cross-platform consistency without needing additional C library bindings. Extreme Performance Optimization: The underlying I/O leverages Tokio's TcpStream and asynchronous buffering. It automatically enables TCP_NODELAY and defaults to disabling SO_LINGER, making it well-suited for high-frequency request environments. Flexible Middleware Mechanism: Offers request_middleware and response_middleware with clear distinctions, simplifying control over the request lifecycle. Real-time Communication Built-in: Native support for WebSocket and SSE, eliminating the need for third-party plugin extensions. Practical Examination: Hyperlane Example Analysis Next, we'll dissect a complete Hyperlane service example to demonstrate its design philosophy and developer-friendliness. 1️⃣ Middleware Configuration is Straightforward and Consistent async fn request_middleware(ctx: Context) { let socket_addr = ctx.get_socket_addr_or_default_string().await; ctx.set_response_header(SERVER, HYPERLANE) .await .set_response_header(\"SocketAddr\", socket_addr) .await; } Unlike other frameworks that require middleware registration via traits or layers, Hyperlane utilizes async functions for direct registration, which is intuitive and simple. 2️⃣ Support for Multiple HTTP Method Route Macros #[methods(get, post)] async fn root_route(ctx: Context) { ctx.set_response_status_code(200) .await .set_response_body(\"Hello hyperlane => /\") .await; } In contrast to Axum, which only supports single method macros, Hyperlane allows combining multiple methods. This reduces code duplication and enhances development efficiency. 3️⃣ WebSocket Example #[get] async fn ws_route(ctx: Context) { let key = ctx.get_request_header(SEC_WEBSOCKET_KEY).await.unwrap(); let body = ctx.get_request_body().await; let _ = ctx.set_response_body(key).await.send_body().await; let _ = ctx.set_response_body(body).await.send_body().await; } Without requiring extra extensions, Hyperlane natively supports WebSocket upgrades and stream processing. This makes it more suitable for building real-time applications such as chat rooms and games. 4️⃣ SSE Data Push #[post] async fn sse_route(ctx: Context) { ctx.set_response_header(CONTENT_TYPE, TEXT_EVENT_STREAM) .await .send() .await; for i in 0..10 { ctx.set_response_body(format!(\"data:{}{}\", i, HTTP_DOUBLE_BR)) .await .send_body() .await; } ctx.closed().await; } The built-in SSE sending mechanism is ideal for long-connection scenarios like monitoring dashboards and push systems, significantly simplifying the implementation of event streams. Robust Routing Capabilities: Support for Dynamic and Regular Expression Matching server.route(\"/dynamic/{routing}\", dynamic_route).await; server.route(\"/dynamic/routing/{file:^.*$}\", dynamic_route).await; Hyperlane's routing system supports dynamic path matching with regular expressions, a feature that often necessitates explicit plugins or complex macro combinations in other frameworks. Performance Focus: Engineered for High Throughput Hyperlane enables performance optimization options by default: server.enable_nodelay().await; server.disable_linger().await; server.http_line_buffer_size(4096).await; This means it pre-configures suitable TCP and buffer parameters for high-concurrency connection scenarios. Developers can override these settings as needed to ensure low latency and manageable memory usage. Developer-Centric Experience All Hyperlane configurations adopt an asynchronous chain call mode. This eliminates the need for nested configurations or macro combinations, truly embodying \"configuration as code, code as service.\" server .host(\"0.0.0.0\").await .port(60000).await .route(\"/\", root_route).await .run().await .unwrap(); Furthermore, its Context provides a unified interface with APIs such as get_request_header, set_response_body, and send_body, maintaining high consistency and predictable behavior. Conclusion: Why Opt for Hyperlane? Feature Hyperlane Actix-Web Axum Native SSE/WebSocket ✅ ⚠️ Plugin extension ⚠️ Limited support Asynchronous chain API ✅ ❌ ❌ Routing with regular expressions ✅ ⚠️ Limited ❌ Middleware support (full lifecycle) ✅ ✅ ✅ Platform compatibility (Win/Linux/mac) ✅ ❌ ✅ Dependency complexity Very low High Medium Hyperlane is a Rust Web framework engineered for extreme performance, lightweight deployment, and rapid development. If you are developing future-oriented Web applications—be it high-frequency trading APIs, real-time communication services, or embedded HTTP servers—Hyperlane presents a compelling new option to consider.

    "description": "🐦‍ Create beautiful, fast, and easy web applications. Crow C++ is a C++ framework for creating HTTP web services or Websockets. It uses routing similar to Flask from Python, making it easy to use. For more information, watch the video we made about Crow. The Crow documentation recommends using Conan or vcpkg, but these package managers for C and C++ are not very user-friendly, so... In this article, we'll see how to install and run Crow on Windows from scratch—and make it WORK! 📦 Dependencies Before anything else, you'll need the following tools installed on your system. Click the links for installation tutorials on Windows. Git Python GCC Clang Using WinGet, you can install them via PowerShell with these commands: winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget winget install --id=Kitware.CMake -e winget install --id=MartinStorsjo.LLVM-MinGW.UCRT -e winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.11 --scope machine Only GCC requires following the tutorial. Note: After installing it, there's a CMake inside the MinGW folder. To ensure version compatibility, rename cmake to something else. Example: If you run Get-Command cmake in the terminal, it will show this path: Get-Command cmake CommandType Name Version Source ----------- ---- ------- ------ Application cmake.exe 4.0.1.0 C:\\mingw64\\bin\\cmake.exe So, you need to rename it to ensure it uses the other installation (from Kitware). For example: Rename-Item -Path \"C:\\mingw64\\bin\\cmake.exe\" -NewName \"DISABLED-cmake.exe\" Now, when you run Get-Command cmake again, it should show the correct path: C:\\Program Files\\CMake\\bin\\cmake.exe and version: Get-Command cmake CommandType Name Version Source ----------- ---- ------- ------ Application cmake.exe 3.26.0.0 C:\\Program Files\\CMake\\bin\\cmake.exe With that done, let's install Crow C++! 📥 Installing Crow First, create a folder for your Crow project (e.g., on the Desktop) and navigate into it: cd \"$env:USERPROFILE\\Desktop\" New-Item -ItemType Directory \"MyProjectCrow\" Set-Location \"MyProjectCrow\" Crow depends on the ASIO library at compile-time and runtime, so download ASIO from this link: https://think-async.com/Asio/ Click the Download option as shown in the image: The current version (as of this article) is 1.30.0, but if there's a newer one, choose that. You'll be redirected to https://sourceforge.net/projects/asio/files/asio/1.30.2. On SourceForge, download asio-1.30.2.zip. After downloading, extract it (Extract Here), which will create a folder named asio-1.30.2. Rename it to just asio. Cut this asio/ folder and paste it inside your project. Now, inside your MyProjectCrow folder, clone the Crow repository: git clone https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow Move the asio folder from your project (MyProjectCrow) into the cloned Crow folder: Move-Item -Path \"asio\" -Destination \"Crow\" Then navigate into the Crow folder: cd Crow 🛠️ Now Let’s Compile Crow Along with ASIO I organize all my includes in a folder on the C:\\ drive, similar to how Unix uses /usr/include. On Windows, I store everything (SFML3, SFML2, tmxlite, FFmpeg, etc.) in C:\\Includes. So, create this folder and a subfolder C:\\Includes\\crow with this command, as we'll install Crow and ASIO there: New-Item -Path \"C:/Includes/crow\" -ItemType Directory Now, still inside the Crow folder in your project, compile with this command: Note the dot (.) at the end—it's important! cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\"C:/Includes/crow\" -DASIO_INCLUDE_DIR=\"./asio\" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-I./asio\" -DCROW_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DCROW_BUILD_TESTS=OFF .

    "title": "Introducing Toolkits: Composable AI Agent Capabilities In PHP",
    "description": "The philosophy behind Neuron's toolkit system emerged from a fundamental observation during AI Agents development: while individual tools provide specific capabilities, real-world AI agents often require coordinated sets of related functionalities. Rather than forcing developers to manually assemble collections of tools for common use cases, Neuron introduces toolkits as an abstraction layer that transforms how we think about agent capability composition. The traditional approach requires instantiating each tool individually. Imagine you want to build agents that need mathematical reasoning – addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation tools must all be declared separately in the agent’s tool configuration. This granular approach quickly becomes unwieldy when agents require comprehensive functionality sets. Toolkits represent Neuron's solution to this complexity, packaging tools created around the same scope into a single, coherent interface that can be attached to any agent with a single line of code. Here is an example of the CalculatorToolkit: namespace NeuronAI\\Tools\\Toolkits\\Calculator; use NeuronAI\\Tools\\Toolkits\\AbstractToolkit; class CalculatorToolkit extends AbstractToolkit { public function guidelines(): ?string { return \"This toolkit allows you to perform mathematical operations. You can also use this functions to solve mathematical expressions executing smaller operations step by step to calculate the final result.\"; } public function provide(): array { return [ SumTool::make(), SubtractTool::make(), MultiplyTool::make(), DivideTool::make(), ExponentiateTool::make(), ]; } } The AbstractToolkit base class establishes a consistent interface that all toolkits inherit, ensuring predictable behavior across the framework. The guidelines() method provides contextual information that helps the underlying language model understand not just what tools are available, but how they should be used together. In the case of the CalculatorToolkit, the guidelines explicitly suggest that complex mathematical expressions can be solved through step-by-step operations, guiding the agent toward effective problem-solving strategies. The provide() method returns the array of tools included in the toolkit by default. When a toolkit is attached to an agent, the individual tools become available exactly as if they had been added separately, but without the cognitive overhead of managing multiple tool declarations. Here is how you can add it to your agent: <?php namesoace App\\Neuron; use NeuronAI\\Agent; use NeuronAI\\Tools\\Calculator\\CalculatorToolkit; class MyAgent extens Agent { ... public function tools(): array { return [ CalculatorToolkit::make(), ]; } } This approach maintains consistency with individual tool usage while providing the organizational benefits of grouped functionalities. If you want to learn from a practical implementation read the article below about creating a Data Analyst Agent with the MySQLToolkit: https://inspector.dev/mysql-ai-toolkit-bringing-intelligence-to-your-database-layer-in-php/ Exclude Tools One of the most powerful aspects of Neuron's toolkit system is the selective exclusion capability. During development of complex agents, I’ve frequently encountered scenarios where a toolkit provides mostly the right functionality but includes tools that could lead to undesired behavior in specific contexts. The exclude() method addresses this challenge elegantly, allowing developers to exclude a subset of tools from the toolkit. This becomes particularly useful when working with specialized agents that require limited capabilities, so you can reduce the probability of an agent to make mistakes, and why not reduce tokens consumption. <?php namespace App\\Neuron; use NeuronAI\\Agent; use NeuronAI\\Tools\\Calculator\\CalculatorToolkit; use NeuronAI\\Tools\\Toolkits\\Calculator\\DivideTool; use NeuronAI\\Tools\\Toolkits\\Calculator\\ExponentiateTool; use NeuronAI\\Tools\\Toolkits\\Calculator\\MultiplyTool; class MyAgent extends Agent { ... public function tools(): array { return [ CalculatorToolkit::make()->exclude([ DivideTool::class, ExponentiateTool::class, MultiplyTool::class, ]), ]; } } The exclusion mechanism operates at the class level, using fully qualified class names to identify tools for removal. This selective approach eliminates the need to create custom toolkit variations for every possible combination of required tools. Extensibility & Ecosystem Opportunity From an extensibility perspective, the toolkit system opens remarkable opportunities for community contribution and ecosystem growth. The consistent interface means that third-party developers can create domain-specific toolkits that integrate seamlessly with Neuron’s architecture. A developer building agents for financial applications might create a FinancialToolkit that includes tools for currency conversion, interest calculation, and risk assessment. Similarly, a WebScrapingToolkit could package HTTP request tools, HTML parsing capabilities, and data extraction utilities into a single, reusable component. The implications for development velocity are profound. In my experience building production agents with Neuron, the toolkit system reduces the cognitive load of capability management while maintaining the flexibility that professional development demands. Instead of researching and configuring multiple individual tools, developers can leverage pre-built, tested toolkit combinations that represent common functionality patterns. This approach accelerates the initial development phase while providing clear extension points for customization as requirements evolve. The toolkit architecture also promotes better code organization and maintainability. Related tools naturally cluster together in the same namespace, making it easier to understand an agent’s capabilities at a glance. When debugging or extending agent behavior, developers can reason about functionality at the toolkit level before diving into individual tool implementations. We know that production agents need reliable, well-tested combinations of capabilities rather than just single tools. By providing both the flexibility of individual tools and the convenience of pre-assembled toolkits, Neuron accommodates both rapid prototyping and sophisticated production deployments within a single, coherent architecture. The future potential of this system extends beyond current implementations. As the Neuron ecosystem grows, community-contributed toolkits could emerge as specialized capability libraries, much like how package ecosystems have evolved in other domains. A marketplace of verified, tested toolkits could dramatically accelerate agent development across industries, with each toolkit representing accumulated expertise in specific problem domains. This is our vision of NeuronAI as a platform for shared AI capability development, positioning PHP developers at the forefront of business-grade AI agent development.

    "title": "The Heartbeat of Modern Web Applications（1750425506005500）",
    "description": "As a third-year student deeply passionate about computer science, I am often amazed by the captivating \"real-time\" nature of modern internet applications. Whether it's the split-second delivery of messages in instant messaging software, the seamless synchronization of multi-person editing in online collaborative documents, or the millisecond-level data refresh on financial trading platforms, these seemingly ordinary functions are all supported by powerful backend technologies. In my exploratory journey, the combination of asynchronous programming and high-performance frameworks has proven to be key to achieving this \"pulse of real-time interaction.\" Recently, a web backend framework, with its outstanding asynchronous processing capabilities and deep optimization for real-time scenarios, has allowed me to experience an unprecedented development thrill, akin to a \"heartbeat sync.\" Real-Time Interaction: The \"Heartbeat\" of Modern Web Applications Once, web applications were more about one-way information display. Users initiated requests, and servers returned static or dynamically generated content; the interaction model was relatively simple. However, with technological advancements and rising user expectations, web applications are no longer satisfied with this \"delayed gratification.\" Users crave instant feedback, real-time updates, and seamless collaboration. This pursuit of \"real-time\" has become an important criterion for judging the quality of a modern web application. Instant Messaging (IM): WeChat, Slack, Discord, etc., where message sending and receiving have almost no delay. Online Games: Players' actions need real-time synchronization; any lag can affect the gaming experience. Collaborative Editing: Google Docs, Figma, etc., where multiple people edit the same document simultaneously, and changes are immediately visible. Real-Time Data Monitoring: Stock quotes, server statuses, IoT device data, etc., need to be continuously pushed to clients. Live Streaming and Video Conferencing: Low-latency transmission of audio/video streams and real-time response of interactive features. Implementing these complex real-time interactive functions places extremely high demands on backend frameworks. They not only need to handle massive concurrent connections but also complete message reception, processing, and distribution with extremely low latency. Traditional synchronous blocking programming models often fall short in these scenarios. The asynchronous non-blocking model, on the other hand, has become the inevitable choice for building high-performance real-time applications. As a learner with the keen insight into technological trends of a \"ten-year veteran developer,\" I am well aware that choosing a framework that natively supports and deeply optimizes asynchronous processing means winning at the starting line when developing real-time applications. The Magic of Asynchrony: Unleashing the Full Potential of Servers Before encountering this \"mysterious\" framework, my understanding of asynchronous programming was mostly limited to Node.js's event loop and callback functions, or Python's async/await syntactic sugar. While they can achieve non-blocking I/O, they sometimes encounter bottlenecks in extreme concurrency and performance-critical scenarios, or require developers to put in extra effort for optimization. This Rust-based framework, however, has its asynchronous processing capabilities deeply embedded in its DNA. The Rust language itself provides elegant asynchronous programming syntax through async/await, and its ecosystem's Tokio (or similar async-std) asynchronous runtime provides a solid foundation for building high-performance network applications. Ultimate Utilization of Non-Blocking I/O The core network layer of this framework is entirely built on a non-blocking I/O model. When a request needs to wait for external resources (such as database queries, file I/O, third-party API calls, or waiting for client data), it doesn't foolishly block the current thread. Instead, it immediately releases CPU control to other tasks that require computation. Once the I/O operation is complete, the operating system wakes up the corresponding task to continue execution via an event notification mechanism. This mechanism allows the server to handle tens of thousands of concurrent connections with minimal thread resources, greatly improving CPU utilization and system throughput. I once tried to implement a simple WebSocket chat room with it. When simulating a large number of users sending messages simultaneously, the server's CPU usage remained at a low level, and message transmission latency was negligible. This composed performance starkly contrasted with versions I had previously implemented with some synchronous frameworks, which showed significant performance degradation or even thread exhaustion at slightly higher concurrency levels. Efficient Scheduling of Lightweight Tasks (Coroutines) The framework typically encapsulates each incoming connection or each independent asynchronous operation into a lightweight task (often called a Future or Task in Rust, similar to coroutines or green threads in other languages). These tasks are efficiently scheduled by an asynchronous runtime like Tokio. Compared to traditional operating system threads, the creation and context-switching overhead of these lightweight tasks is minimal, allowing the server to easily support hundreds of thousands or even millions of concurrent tasks. This M:N threading model (M user-level tasks mapped to N kernel-level threads) allows developers to write asynchronous logic much like synchronous code, without worrying about underlying thread management and complex concurrency control. The framework and asynchronous runtime handle everything for us. Elegant Error Handling and Cancellation Mechanisms In asynchronous programming, error handling and task cancellation are common difficulties. Rust's Result type and ? operator make error propagation and handling in asynchronous functions very clear and safe. Additionally, asynchronous runtimes like Tokio provide robust task cancellation mechanisms (Cancellation Safety). When a task no longer needs to execute (e.g., the client disconnects), it can be safely canceled, releasing its occupied resources and preventing resource leaks. This framework fully leverages these language and runtime features, enabling developers to more calmly handle various exceptional situations when building complex real-time applications. Framework Advantages in Real-Time Scenarios: Why Can It Achieve \"Heartbeat Sync\"? After an in-depth experience with this framework, I found it exhibits many unique advantages in supporting real-time interactive applications: Native WebSocket and SSE Support WebSocket provides full-duplex communication channels, making it an ideal choice for building highly interactive applications like instant messaging and online games. Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a lightweight mechanism for servers to unilaterally push events to clients, suitable for scenarios like news feeds and status updates. This framework typically offers native, high-performance support for WebSocket and SSE. Its API design is concise and easy to use, allowing developers to easily create WebSocket connection handlers and manage events like connection establishment, message reception, and connection closure. The framework's underlying layers encapsulate details like WebSocket protocol handshakes, frame processing, and heartbeat maintenance, letting developers focus on business logic. I once quickly built a real-time polling system with it. Clients connected to the server via WebSocket, and when the server received a vote, it broadcasted the latest polling results in real-time to all connected clients. The development process was very smooth, and the performance was satisfactory. Efficient Message Broadcasting and Distribution Mechanisms In many real-time applications, messages or events need to be broadcast to multiple clients (e.g., group chat messages in a chat room, status updates for all players in a game). Inefficient broadcasting mechanisms can easily become performance bottlenecks. This framework's ecosystem often includes efficient Publish/Subscribe or Broadcast components (e.g., Tokio's broadcast channel). These components are carefully designed to distribute messages to a large number of subscribers in an asynchronous environment with minimal overhead. They usually support multi-producer, multi-consumer patterns and gracefully handle subscriber joins and leaves. This built-in efficient broadcasting capability means developers don't need to reinvent the wheel when implementing group communication or real-time data push features, and it avoids performance issues caused by improper implementation. Low-Latency Request Processing Pipeline For real-time applications, every millisecond of latency can impact user experience. This framework's entire pipeline, from request reception, parsing, and processing to response sending, is optimized for maximum performance. Its lightweight core, efficient route matching, and zero-copy data handling techniques (if applicable) all contribute to minimizing processing latency. The Rust language itself has no GC pauses, which also guarantees its low-latency characteristics. In real-time scenarios requiring complex computations or large amounts of data processing (such as real-time data analysis and visualization), this low-latency advantage becomes even more apparent. Flexible Protocol Support and Extensibility Although WebSocket and HTTP are the primary protocols for web real-time communication, some specific scenarios may require support for other custom or binary protocols (like Protobuf, MQTT, etc.). This framework usually has good protocol extensibility, allowing developers to easily integrate or implement custom protocol handlers. Rust's powerful byte manipulation capabilities and rich serialization/deserialization libraries (like Serde) also provide convenience for handling various complex data formats. State Management and Concurrency Control Real-time applications often need to maintain a large amount of connection state and user state on the server side. Efficiently managing this state while ensuring concurrency safety is a challenge. Rust's ownership and borrowing system, along with its concurrency primitives (like Mutex, RwLock, Channel), provide strong support for building thread-safe state management modules. The framework itself might also offer recommended state management patterns or examples of integration with popular state storage solutions (like Redis) to help developers better address this challenge. Practical Case: Building an Online Collaborative Whiteboard To personally experience this framework's capabilities in complex real-time scenarios, I attempted to build a simple online collaborative whiteboard application. It allows multiple users to connect simultaneously and draw on a shared canvas, with all users' actions synchronized in real-time to others. In this project, I primarily utilized the framework's WebSocket support for bidirectional communication between clients and the server. Each user's drawing action (like drawing lines, circles, or writing text) was sent to the server via WebSocket. Upon receiving an action, the server broadcasted it to all other users in the same room. The server also needed to maintain the current state of the whiteboard so that new users joining could retrieve the complete canvas content. During development, I deeply appreciated the power of the framework's asynchronous processing capabilities. Even with multiple users performing high-frequency drawing operations simultaneously, the server remained stable, and message synchronization latency was almost imperceptible. Rust's strong type system and compile-time checks also helped me avoid many potential concurrency errors and logical flaws. I also used the framework's middleware mechanism to implement simple user authentication and room management functions. With the framework's help, the backend logic of the entire application appeared very clear and easy to maintain. Comparative Reflection: Why Does It Excel in the Real-Time Domain? Compared to some traditional PHP or Python frameworks, which often require additional extensions (like Swoole, Gevent) or more complex architectures (like using a separate WebSocket server) to handle a large number of long connections and high-concurrency real-time messages, this Rust-based framework has innate asynchronous and concurrent capabilities. It doesn't need extra \"plugins\" to deliver top-tier real-time processing performance. Compared to Node.js, although Node.js is also a paragon of asynchronous non-blocking I/O, Rust generally has an edge in CPU-intensive tasks and memory safety. For real-time applications requiring complex computations or extremely high stability (such as financial trading, real-time risk control), a Rust framework might be a more robust choice. Compared to Java's Netty or Go's goroutines, they are all excellent choices for building high-performance real-time applications. However, a Rust framework, with its GC-less nature, memory safety, and execution efficiency close to C/C++, might exhibit stronger competitiveness in scenarios with extreme demands on latency and resource consumption. Furthermore, Rust's async/await syntax and ecosystem offer a very modern and efficient asynchronous programming experience. Conclusion: Making the Application's \"Heartbeat\" Stronger and More Powerful Real-time interaction has become an indispensable core competency for modern web applications. Choosing a backend framework that can efficiently handle concurrent connections, respond with low latency, and provide convenient real-time communication mechanisms is key to creating an excellent user experience. This \"mysterious\" Rust framework, with its deeply ingrained asynchronous processing capabilities, native support for real-time protocols like WebSocket, and efficient message distribution mechanisms, provides developers with a powerful arsenal for building various complex real-time applications. It has allowed me to experience a development joy akin to a \"heartbeat sync\" with the server and has filled me with anticipation for the future development of real-time technology. As a computer science student, I am well aware that the tide of technology never stops. Mastering and applying such a framework, which represents advanced productivity, will undoubtedly add significant weight to my future career. I believe that as more developers recognize its value, it will surely play an even more vibrant \"heartbeat\" symphony in the field of real-time applications.

    "description": "My Experience with Hyperlane Introducing Hyperlane: The Next-Gen Rust Web Framework Hyperlane is a high-performance, lightweight, and developer-friendly Rust Web framework. It is engineered for extreme speed, zero platform dependency, and a modern development experience. Hyperlane leverages Rust's safety and concurrency, providing blazing-fast HTTP services and robust real-time communication support. Performance Highlights: Stunning Benchmark Results wrk test (single-core): Hyperlane: QPS 120,000+ actix-web: QPS 90,000+ axum: QPS 80,000+ ab test (10,000 requests, 100 concurrency): Hyperlane: QPS 110,000+ actix-web: QPS 85,000+ axum: QPS 75,000+ For more details and quick start templates, visit the Hyperlane GitHub page. I. Discovering ctx: A Thoughtfully Designed Abstraction My initial foray into writing route functions with Hyperlane introduced me to its Context (or ctx). I was immediately struck by its design. I remember when I first needed to retrieve the request method. In more conventional Rust HTTP frameworks, the code would typically look like this: let method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method(); Hyperlane, however, streamlines this: let method = ctx.get_request_method().await; This approach is akin to a well-organized backpack; the framework has systematically renamed subfields of requests and responses. For example, setting the response status code transformed from set_status_code to set_response_status_code. While this adds a few characters, it significantly clarifies the code's logic, making it as easy to follow as a flowchart. I no longer found myself constantly consulting documentation to understand the method hierarchy. II. Route Macros: A Welcome Convenience The request method macros were a real game-changer for me. While developing the homepage route, I experimented with the #[methods(get, post)] combined annotation. This proved to be much more straightforward than declaring each enum value separately. I later found I could simplify it even further to #[get]. Suddenly, writing routes felt as intuitive as composing Markdown: #[get] async fn ws_route(ctx: Context) { let key = ctx.get_request_header(SEC_WEBSOCKET_KEY).await.unwrap(); let body = ctx.get_request_body().await; ctx.set_response_body(key).await.send_body().await; ctx.set_response_body(body).await.send_body().await; } On one occasion, a teammate mistakenly typed #[postman] instead of #[post]. The framework responded with a helpful error message, a stark contrast to some frameworks that merely throw a cryptic compilation error. Hyperlane's beginner-friendly nature is truly commendable. III. The Middleware Onion Model: Unpacking Request Processing Working on user authentication provided my first real insight into the elegance of the middleware onion model. I sketched a flowchart based on the documentation (my Mermaid diagramming skills were still developing) and understood how a request navigates from the outer layers of the onion inward: graph TD A[Client Request] --> B[Authentication Middleware] B --> C[Logging Middleware] C --> D[Controller] D --> E[Response Formatting Middleware] E --> F[Client Response] I implemented a JWT verification middleware. If an invalid token is detected, I can simply use ctx.aborted() to halt further processing. This \"short-circuit\" capability is far more efficient than duplicating verification logic in every route. I recall an instance where, to debug middleware sequencing, I intentionally placed the logging middleware after authentication. The request logs subsequently filled with authentication errors, underscoring the strictness of middleware order, much like the layers of an onion. IV. WebSocket Support: Effortless Real-Time Chat The most demanding aspect of the project was implementing the real-time chat feature. To my pleasant surprise, Hyperlane’s WebSocket lifecycle is very clearly defined. The documentation's flowchart illustrates the process: graph TD A[Client Connection] --> Z[Pre-upgrade Processing] Z --> Y[WebSocket Handshake] Y --> X[Connection Established Callback] X --> B[Middleware Processing] B --> C[Message Handling Controller] C --> D[Response Handling] I managed to complete the WebSocket module in a single evening. The ctx.closed() method, in particular, allows for gracefully closing the connection when a user leaves the chat. During testing, I observed that even with 100 users chatting concurrently, server resource consumption remained stable. A roommate had previously developed a similar feature in Node.js, which crashed under a 50-person test. This comparison was a significant confidence booster. V. Dynamic Routing: The Fun of Regex in Parameters When developing the product detail page route, I made use of dynamic parameters. The standard route /goods/{id} is straightforward, but when I needed to restrict the parameter to numerical values, I discovered I could write: server.route(\"/goods/{id:\\\\d+}\", |ctx| async move { let id = ctx.get_route_param(\"id\").await.parse::<u32>().unwrap(); // Database query logic... }).await; This regex-based parameter matching reminded me of a Regex assignment from class. However, the framework conveniently encapsulates the complex parsing. Once, I mistakenly wrote the regex as {id:\\\\D+}. Instead of a server error, the framework returned a 404. I later learned this is part of its route error handling mechanism, and the attention to detail is truly impressive. VI. Performance Testing: Outperforming Gin?! Before the final course presentation, I ran a performance test using wrk with the command: wrk -c360 -d60s http://127.0.0.1:6000/ The results were astonishing: Hyperlane’s QPS exceeded 320,000, nearly 30% faster than an identical interface my roommate had built using Gin! While slightly slower than the underlying Tokio library, this level of performance from an upper-layer framework is more than adequate to support thousands of students using the platform simultaneously. During the presentation, when the instructor saw this data, he inquired if I had secretly optimized the server. In reality, I had simply run it with the default configuration from the documentation. VII. From Challenges to Appreciation: A Rust Framework's Evolution In my early days with Hyperlane, I encountered a few hurdles. For instance, in versions prior to v4.0.0, the execution order of synchronous routes and asynchronous middleware led to a lengthy debugging session. Another time, I forgot to call send_body() in the WebSocket processing, which prevented messages from being sent. However, each time I consulted the documentation, I found clear version descriptions. The lifecycle evolution chart, in particular, vividly illustrates the changes from v3.0.0 to v5.25.1: After v4.22.0, ctx.aborted() can interrupt requests, much like a \"pause\" feature in a game. ctx.closed() in v5.25.1 allows for actively closing connections, resolving a long-connection resource leakage issue I had previously faced. Now, the project is deployed on the university server, handling hundreds of transactions daily, and Hyperlane has consistently performed reliably. As a newcomer transitioning from C++ to Rust, I genuinely feel that this framework strikes an excellent balance between performance and ease of use. It is particularly welcoming to student developers—the example code in the documentation can be readily copied and used, unlike some frameworks that require a significant time investment to understand their architecture before getting started. If you're also undertaking a Rust Web project, I wholeheartedly recommend giving Hyperlane a try. The experience of writing code that feels like assembling building blocks truly makes programming an enjoyable endeavor. A Note on the URL I noticed a mention of the URL (http://127.0.0.1:6000/). It seems there was an issue resolving this webpage. This could be due to network problems or an invalid link. Please double-check the URL's validity and attempt to access it again. If you need further assistance with the content of that webpage, please let me know. For more information, please visit Hyperlane's GitHub page or contact the author: root@ltpp.vip."

    "title": "⏱ When Milliseconds Aren't Enough: A Pragmatic Take on ULID Overflow",
    "description": "This is a shortened version of an article originally published on my blog. You can find the full version here). We all love ULIDs. They're sortable, unique enough for most purposes, and a great alternative to UUIDs. The spec is pretty clear on how to handle things, but there's one edge case that's worth talking about: what do you do when you generate so many ULIDs in the same millisecond that you run out of random bits? The official spec says to throw an overflow exception. And while that's a valid, by-the-book answer, it's not always the most practical one. In a high-throughput system, throwing an exception is a failure condition. It's something you want to avoid. So, in our C# ULID library, ByteAether.Ulid, we took a different path. When the 80-bit random part of the ULID overflows, we just increment the 48-bit timestamp by one millisecond. Here’s why we think this is a better approach for real-world applications: No More Overflow Exceptions! 🙌 This means more reliable systems, especially when you're generating a ton of IDs. Performance for the Win. 🚀 We sidestep the performance hit that comes with exception handling and other workarounds. Keep Calm and Sort On. Your IDs will still be perfectly sortable within a single process. We know this is a documented deviation from the spec. But let's be real: cross-process millisecond ordering is already a bit fuzzy. A one-millisecond bump to the timestamp in a rare overflow situation is a small price to pay for a more resilient and performant system. Check out ByteAether.Ulid on GitHub and see what you think. We're betting that for most developers, this pragmatic approach to ULID generation is the way to go."

    "title": "Como Instalar o Crow C++ no Windows",
    "description": "🐦‍ Crie lindas aplicações Web velozes e de forma fácil. Crow C++ é um framework C++ para criar serviços web HTTP ou Websocket. Ele usa roteamento semelhante ao Flask do Python, o que facilita o uso. Para mais informações veja o vídeo que fizemos sobre o Crow. Na documentação do Crow orienta você usar o Conan ou vcpkg, mas esses gerenciadores de pacotes para C e C++ não são nada amigáveis, então... Nesse artigo vamos ver como instalar e rodar o Crow no Windows do zero e FUNCIONANDO! 📦 Dependências Antes de mais nada você vai precisar ter instalado no seu sistema os seguintes utiltários. Clique nos links para um tutorial de instalação no Windows. Git Python GCC Clang Usando o WinGet se resume em instalar via PowerShell com os comandos: winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget winget install --id=Kitware.CMake -e winget install --id=MartinStorsjo.LLVM-MinGW.UCRT -e winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.11 --scope machine Só o GCC que você precisará seguir o tutorial. Detalhe é que após instalá-lo, existe um CMake dentro da pasta MinGW, então para haver compatibilidade de versão renomei o cmake para outro nome. Exemplo: Se você rodar o comando: Get-Command cmake no terminal aparecerá esse caminho:  Get-Command cmake CommandType Name Version Source ----------- ---- ------- ------ Application cmake.exe 4.0.1.0 C:\\mingw64\\bin\\cmake.exe Então, vc precisa renomear para outro nome, para que ele execute o cmake da outra instalação(a da Kitware), renomei assim, por exemplo: Rename-Item -Path \"C:\\mingw64\\bin\\cmake.exe\" -NewName \"DISABLED-cmake.exe\" Quando vc rodar de novo o comando: Get-Command cmake agora aparecerá outro caminho: C:\\Program Files\\CMake\\bin\\cmake.exe e versão também:  Get-Command cmake CommandType Name Version Source ----------- ---- ------- ------ Application cmake.exe 3.26.0.0 C:\\Program Files\\CMake\\bin\\cmake.exe Feito isso, agora vamos instalar o Crow C++! 📥 Instalando o Crow Antes de mais nada crie uma pasta para seu projeto Crow, exemplo no Desktop e entre na pasta do seu projeto: cd \"$env:USERPROFILE\\Desktop\" New-Item -ItemType Directory \"MyProjectCrow\" Set-Location \"MyProjectCrow\" O Crow depende da biblioteca ASIO em tempo de compilação e em tempo de execução, então, faça o download da ASIO nesse link: https://think-async.com/Asio/ Clique na opção Download como na imagem: A versão atual(de acordo com a postagem desse artigo é 1.30.0, mas se houver uma mais recente, escolha-a) Você será redicionado para o https://sourceforge.net/projects/asio/files/asio/1.30.2. No SourceForge faça o download da versão asio-1.30.2.zip. Após finalizado descompacte em: Extrair aqui ele criará uma pasta descompactada de nome: asio-1.30.2, renomei ela para asio somente. Recorte essa pasta descompactada que você renomeou para asio/ e cole dentro do seu projeto. Agora, dentro da sua pasta MyProCrow, clone o repositório do Crow git clone https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow Mova a asio que está no seu projeto/pasta MyProCrow para dentro da pasta Crow que você clonou: Move-Item -Path \"asio\" -Destination \"Crow\" E entre na pasta do Crow: cd Crow 🛠️ Agora vamos Compilar o Crow junto com a ASIO Eu organizo todos meus include em uma pasta na unidade C:\\, assim como no Unix fica em /usr/include no Windows em guardo tudo(SFML3, SFML2, tmxlite, FFmpeg,...) em C:\\Includes. Enão crie essa pasta e juntamente com a subpasta C:\\Includes\\crow com esse comando, pois é nesse caminho que vamos instalar o Crow e a ASIO: New-Item -Path \"C:/Includes/crow\" -ItemType Directory Agora, ainda dentro da pasta Crow no seu projeto compile com esse comando: Termina com um ponto(.) no final, esse ponto no final é importante também copiá-lo! cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\"C:/Includes/crow\" -DASIO_INCLUDE_DIR=\"./asio\" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-I./asio\" -DCROW_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DCROW_BUILD_TESTS=OFF .

Remove-Item -Path \"Crow\" -Recurse -Force Pronto! Agora vamos testar nosso projeto! ⚙️ Rodar um Hello, World! no servidor com Crow Agora sua pasta/projeto MyProjectCrow está vazia. Vamos criar um arquivo main.cpp dentro dela, exemplo com VSCode: code main.cpp E cole isso dentro: #include \"crow.h\"  int main(){ crow::SimpleApp app; CROW_ROUTE(app, \"/\")([](){ return \"Hello world\"; }); app.port(18080).multithreaded().run(); } Salve o arquivo e volte para o terminal e compile seu projeto com esse comando: Confirme esses caminhos porque pode ser que você tenhas subpastas. Logo dentro de asio tem que tem uma include: C:/Includes/asio/include. g++ main.cpp -I\"C:/Includes/asio/include\" -I\"C:/Includes/crow/include\" -lws2_32 -lmswsock -o app.exe Vai gerar o arquivo: .\\app.exe, execute-o: Vai aparecer isso:  .\\app.exe (2025-06-20 03:58:29) [INFO ] Crow/master server is running at http://0.0.0.0:18080 using 2 threads (2025-06-20 03:58:29) [INFO ] Call `app.loglevel(crow::LogLevel::Warning)` to hide Info level logs.

I'm currently in a journey to learn and improve my Elixir and Go skills (my daily job uses C++) and looking through my backlog for projects to take on I decided Elixir is the perfect language to write a highly-parallel BitTorrent tracker. So I have spent my free time these last 3 months writing one! Now I think it has enough features to present it to the world (and a docker image to give it a quick try). I know some people see trackers as relics of the past now that DHT and PEX are common but I think they still serve a purpose in today's Internet (purely talking about public trackers). That said there is not a lot going on in terms of new developments since everyone just throws opentracker in a vps a calls it a day (honorable exceptions: aquatic and torrust). I plan to continue development for the foreseeable future and add some (optional) esoteric features along the way so if anyone currently operates a tracker please give a try and enjoy the lack of crashes. note: only swarm_printout.ex has been vibe coded, the rest has all been written by hand."

    "description": "I've found it helps PR reviewers when they can look through a set of commits with clear messages and logically organized changes. Typically reviewers prefer a larger quantity of smaller changes versus a smaller quantity of larger changes. Sometimes it gets really messy to break up a change into sufficiently small PRs, so thoughtful commits are a great way of further subdividing changes in PRs. It can be pretty time consuming to do this though, so this tool automates the process with the help of AI. The tool sends the diff of your git branch against a base branch to an LLM provider. The LLM provider responds with a set of suggested commits with sensible commit messages, change groupings, and descriptions. When you explicitly accept the proposed changes, the tool re-writes the commit history on your branch to match the LLM's suggestion. Then you can force push your branch to your remote to make it match. The default AI provider is your locally running Ollama server. Cloud providers can be explicitly configured via CLI argument or in a config file, but keeping local models as the default helps to protect against unintentional data sharing. The tool always creates a backup branch in case you need to easily revert in case of changing your mind or an error in commit re-writing. Note that re-writing commit history to a remote branch requires a force push, which is something your team/org will need to be ok with. As long as you are working on a feature branch this is usually fine, but it's always worth checking if you are not sure."
